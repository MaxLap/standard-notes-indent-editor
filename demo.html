This is a demo of the Indent Editor for Standard Notes.

You can type around and get a feel for it.

Empty lines are small, giving you more control over spacing

There is more space between lines compared to a basic plaintext editor
Its minor, but helps with readability along with other features.

Press Tab to indent the current line by 2 spaces
Press Shift + Tab to de-indent the current line by 2 spaces

    These lines are indented
    Pressing Enter copies the indentation for the new line

      Lines can wrap! This is a long line to show that the text will end up wrapping when it reaches the end of the screen. You may notice that the wrapped part is shown at the same indentation as the first line of the paragraph!

    * Stars (*), dashes (-), greater than (>) and plus (+) that are before text are considered part of indentation. So wrapped lines are indented until after them. This is great for making lists. The font for these special indentation characters is fixed-width, so things always line up.
    * When you press enter, the * - > + that are indentation are also copied.

* You may have already noticed that lines that wrap don't go as far right as they could. This avoids paragraph that are super large and hard to read. This is based on a number of characters of width, so it has no effect on mobile. Also for that readability goal, lines that wrap have a little bit less space between the lines.
* You can see the little extra spacing between this line and the above paragraph.

You can use `backticks` to have a piece of code in a line.

You can use ``` triple backticks for code blocks. Put them at the end of a line (or as the only thing on the line) and code formatting will be applied until the next time a triple backticks is found at the end of a line.
So here is some code: ```
    function hello() {
        console.log("Hello world");
    }
```

  * The code will follow the indentation of the line with triple backticks: ```
      function hello() {
          console.log("Hello world");
      }
      ```
      Or of the first line of code, whichever one is less indented:
      ```
    function hello() {
      console.log("Hello world");
      # Also of note: Empty lines have regular spacing.

    }
```

This is still a work in progress:
* Other simple features will be added to help with readability and usability
* Some things are not final and may be improved
* Things I'm not totally happy with right now:
  * The spacing between lines. In some cases, I feel the lines should be closer together.
  * The overall look of code blocks, especially for empty lines

Now that you tried the editor, you can follow these instructions to install it in your Standard Notes:
